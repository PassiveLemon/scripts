# scripts
These are just some scripts I have made to simplify some things.

Details about each script is in the wiki.

## TODO:
Cause: Reduce length of lines by using variables for file paths </br>
Effect: Much cleaner code </br>
</br>
Cause: For Retroarch and Turnsignal, download the archives to their respective locations </br>
Effect: Less transfers and copies necessary </br>
</br>
Various other code improvements if necessary. </br>
